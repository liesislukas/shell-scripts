# shell-scripts
These are my own built scripts or just gathered from random places bits of shell script to make things happen


- log.sh - exposes 2 functions `fn_log` and `fn_debug`. also manages logs file.
- [fn_promt.sh](./fn_promt.sh) - confirm action with Y/n and then run if statement by result
