# shell-scripts
These are mostly my own built scripts to make things happen. Yet some are updated by people i had contact with 🎉
 
## Functions 🧐
- [log.sh](./log.sh) - exposes 2 functions `fn_log` and `fn_debug`. also manages logs file.
- [fn_promt.sh](./fn_promt.sh) - confirm action with Y/n and then run if statement by result

## Else 🤯
- [define_basedir_when_calling_script.sh](./define_basedir_when_calling_script.sh) - user enters directory to work with as 1st param. e.g. `cmd .` would set base dir to same dir as cmd is called from
