## Functions üßê
- [log.sh](./log.sh) - exposes 2 functions `fn_log` and `fn_debug`. also manages logs file.

Defined function `fn_install_tools` which is compatible with Debian, RedHat, Alpine, Arch and SuSE package managers. Defines all tools needed with some description for user
then loops through required tools and tries to install if is root, if not - makes a list for user and prints out. Uses custom [fn_promt.sh](./fn_promt.sh) which can be found in this repo to confirm action.
